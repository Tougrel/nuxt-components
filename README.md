# Tougrel's Nuxt Components

Hello everyone! I made this repo to share some components I regularly use to create my websites. You can freely use these on your apps and if you want to suggest a component, you go ahead and open an issue!

## Usage

> To use the components just copy or download the code from here.

```vue
<script setup>
// This is an example of how the components will look inside your code
</script>

<template>
    <Flex row items="center" gap="2">
        <!-- Rest of your code here -->
    </Flex>
    <Grid columns="2" md-columns="3" xl-columns="4">
        <!-- Rest of your code here -->
    </Grid>
</template>
```
