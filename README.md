# Tougrel's Nuxt Components

Hello there! I made this repo to share some components I regularly use to create my websites. You can freely use these on your apps and if you want to suggest a component, you go ahead and open an issue!

## Usage

> This is currently written for typescript only. I will make "classic" method when I find the time.

> To use the components just copy or download the code from here and put them inside your nuxt/vue project. There are both minified and not minified versions so get whatever you like!

```vue
<script lang="ts">
// This is an example of how the components will look inside your code
</script>

<template>
    <Flex row items="center" gap="2">
        <!-- Rest of your code here -->
    </Flex>
    <Grid columns="2" md-columns="3" xl-columns="4">
        <!-- Rest of your code here -->
    </Grid>
</template>
```
